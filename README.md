This project explores the dynamic behavior of a fully connected network of four military robots operating
in formation. The primary objective is to investigate shape formation, and decentralized control
mechanisms applicable to military tank formations. The proposed decentralized controller relies solely on
lidar data for inter-robot communication, enhancing adaptability in diverse environments. The project
utilizes a fully connected network graph, where each robot adheres to reference distances to converge into
specific formations: a trapezium, a square, and a patrolling concentric circle. The robots' positions are
updated through a velocity controller with a proportional error and a direction, adjusting their trajectories
to minimize errors in the reference distances. The theoretical analysis involves proving convergence
properties and stability characteristics of the formations. The decentralized controller is designed to
achieve the desired collective behavior. The mathematical model is based on assumptions that reflect real-
world scenarios, such as sensing and communication capabilities of military robots. Simulations,
conducted over 4000-time steps, demonstrate the convergence of robots to the specified formations. The
trajectories and final orientations of the robots are visualized, providing insights into the effectiveness of
the decentralized controller. The simulations validate the proposed model and controller, emphasizing
their potential applications in military scenarios.
